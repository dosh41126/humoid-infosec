so i was watching TV last night of browsing the movie swordfish was on and the scene where the guy all frantic typing and stuff and idk i think hackers should be looked at in two ways.

the old hackers like Say original Steve jobs hackers.

and new school hackers like Mitnick and the future of hackers (who hack for human freedom, system security, and global peace)

and i wanted to build some new school hacker theory here.

yall please Hack responsibily and be kind to your competitiors . If you are hacking. Do it in a way it helps all humanity forward, do it not for Creds but for collective progress.
